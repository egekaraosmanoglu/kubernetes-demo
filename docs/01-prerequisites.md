# Prerequisites

This tutorial needs these tools:

* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Java Development Kit 1.8

## Docker and Kubernetes

You can install a Docker and set up a Kubernetes instance on your workstation using Docker Desktop.
You can download it [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and spin up the cluster following the documentation for [Windows 10 Pro](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) or [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)

As alternative, you can spin up a Kubernetes cluster with [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube)

## Java Development Kit 1.8

You need also JDK 1.8 to build the Microservice. You can download it [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
